# AAA+ Contrast Color Picker

This tool suggest a color by contrast ratio of least 7:1 between text and background. Since high contrast level will cause eye strain, this tool will only suggest a color on contrast level between 7.1 to 7.5.

(Current version only generate lighter color for chosen base color, in the future maybe add in complementary colors etc.)
