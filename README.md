# AAA+ Contrast Color Picker

This tool suggest a color by contrast ratio of least 7:1 between text and background. Since high contrast level will cause eye strain, this tool only suggest a color on contrast level between 7.1 to 7.5. (maybe future can be adjust by user)

(Current version only generate lighter color for chosen base color, in the future maybe add in complementary colors etc.)
